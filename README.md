# Doppler Visualizer
A simple Javascript Doppler effect visualizer meant to show wavefront propagation from a moving source

## Use
 - Move your mouse, and the wave emitter should follow.
 - The wave emitter will follow at the speed set in the upper right (where $c$ is the speed of wave propagation).
